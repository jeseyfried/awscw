# Salaria Kea
Salaria Kea was an African American nurse from Akron, Ohio, who volunteered for the Spanish Medical Bureau. She was the only Black American woman known to have served in Spain. Working in field hospitals, she tended to both soldiers and civilians near the front lines. Keaâ€™s participation challenged racial and gender barriers simultaneously; she later served as a nurse in World War II and remained a lifelong advocate for racial equality and social justice.
