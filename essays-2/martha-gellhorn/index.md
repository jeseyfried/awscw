# Martha Gellhorn
One of the most famous war correspondents of the 20th century, Gellhorn covered the Spanish Civil War for *Collier’s Weekly*. She reported from Madrid and the frontlines, focusing on the suffering of civilians under bombardment. Her dispatches—later collected in *The Face of War*—became models of literary journalism. Though often overshadowed by her relationship with Hemingway, Gellhorn’s independent voice was one of the most important American witnesses to the war’s human cost.
