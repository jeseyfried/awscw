# Lois Orr
A young American radical from Kentucky, Lois Orr went to Spain with her husband Charles in 1936 shortly after their marriage. They joined the POUM (Workers’ Party of Marxist Unification) in Barcelona and witnessed the internal conflicts within the left during the May Days of 1937. Her letters home (published posthumously as *Letters from Barcelona*) provide a vivid, firsthand record of the daily life of foreign radicals in revolutionary Catalonia.
