# Marion Merriman
Marion Merriman, the wife of Robert Merriman (chief of staff of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion), went to Spain in 1937. A trained economist and political activist, she worked alongside her husband organizing logistics for the International Brigades. After his presumed execution by Nationalist forces, she remained active in antifascist advocacy and later co-authored American Commander in Spain (1996), a memoir of their experiences.
