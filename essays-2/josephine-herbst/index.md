# Josephine Herbst
An established novelist and journalist associated with the literary left, Josephine Herbst went to Spain in 1937 as a correspondent for *The New Republic* and *Collier’s*. She covered both the front and the civilian experience, reporting on the idealism and disillusionment of the Republican cause. Herbst’s reporting and later fiction helped shape the American literary memory of the war; she was a close friend of Ernest Hemingway and John Dos Passos, who also wrote about Spain.
